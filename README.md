# Book Tracking (CLIENT)

This is the client side of a CRUD project used to register and track books that I am reading.




# Demo

# How to Run

Prior to running the client side, you should go to the /app folder and run:

``
    npm install
``

Then, still inside the \app folder, run the following command to start the application:

``
    npm start
``

Note that, since the application works uppon a TCP/IP stack, it'll only function 100% correctly if the server side is already running.
